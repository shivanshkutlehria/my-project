Learnings from the Experiment:
   In this experiment, I learned how to create a simple yet functional Student
   Registration Form using HTML5. I gained practical understanding of various
   input types like 'text', 'email', and number-like entries, and how to apply
   attributes such as 'required', 'placeholder', 'pattern', 'min', and 'max' for
   basic client-side validation.
   I also understood the importance of using the 'label' tag with the 'for'
   attribute to improve accessibility and form usability.

Test Cases/Scenarios Covered :
   - Validation of Name Field:
     Entered the name "Shivansh Kutlehria" to test valid input.
     Also tested with invalid names like "Shivansh123" and "Shiv@ns#"
     which were rejected due to the pattern="[A-Za-z\s]+" restriction.

   - Email Format Checking:
     Provided a valid email like "shivansh@example.com" which passed the validation.
     Then tested with invalid emails such as "shivansh@", "shivansh.com", and
     "shivansh@com" which were flagged as invalid by the browser.

   - Required Field Check:
     Attempted to submit the form without entering the name, email, and age fields
     to confirm that the form does not submit and displays validation messages for
     each missing field.

   - Age Input Validation:
     Entered a valid age of "19", which was accepted.
     Also tested with values like "17" and "150", which were rejected due to the
     min="18" and max="100" restrictions.

   - Successful Submission Test:
     Filled in all fields correctly with:
       Name: Shivansh Kutlehria
       Email: shivansh@example.com
       Age: 19
     The form was successfully submitted, confirming that all validations worked
     as expected.
