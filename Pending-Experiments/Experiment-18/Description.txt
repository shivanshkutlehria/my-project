Experiment 18 – Role-Based Access Control with Admin, User, and Moderator Roles

Overview:
=========
This project demonstrates the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Node.js and Express.js backend application.
It allows for secure access to different routes and actions based on user roles, such as Admin, Moderator, and User.

The system uses JWT-based authentication to verify users and store role information, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific routes.
This experiment provides practical experience with backend security, middleware design, and protected API routes.

Key Features:
============
- User Authentication: Users can log in and receive a JWT token containing their role.
- Role-Based Authorization: Middleware ensures routes are only accessible to users with the required roles.
- Protected Routes: 
    - Admin-only dashboard     
    - Moderator management route     
    - User profile route
- Error Handling: Requests with invalid tokens or insufficient roles return clear error messages.
- Scalable Design: Easy to add new roles or modify access permissions.

Technologies Used:
==================

- Node.js – Server-side runtime environment.
- Express.js – Handles routing and API endpoints.
- JSON Web Token (JWT) – For authentication and role management.
- Body-Parser – To parse incoming JSON request bodies.

Middleware & Security:
=====================
Custom middleware for JWT verification and role checking.

Steps to Run the Project:
========================

Open terminal and navigate to the folder:-------- cd Experiment-18

Install dependencies:-----------npm install

Start the server:----------node index.js


The server will run at: http://localhost:3000

Testing the Routes:
==================
= Login: POST /auth/login with username and password.
= Admin Dashboard: GET /admin/dashboard – Admin only.
= Moderator Route: GET /moderator/manage – Moderator only.
= User Profile: GET /user/profile – Accessible to all authenticated users.
= Include the JWT token in the Authorization header for protected routes.

Learning Outcomes:
=================
- Understand how to create a secure backend API with Node.js and Express.js.
- Learn to authenticate users using JWT and store role information.
- Implement middleware for role-based authorization to restrict access to routes.
- Learn to handle errors gracefully for unauthorized access or invalid tokens.
