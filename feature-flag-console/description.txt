Project Title: Real-Time Feature Flag Management Console (MERN + Redis)

Overview:
A real-time feature flag management system built using the MERN stack with Redis. 
It enables dynamic control over application features through an admin dashboard, ensuring scalability, 
low latency, and consistent updates across distributed environments.

Core Components:

1. Backend (Node.js + Express + Redis + MongoDB)
   - Central API for managing, evaluating, and distributing feature flags.
   - Redis is used for caching and Pub/Sub messaging to sync updates across nodes.
   - MongoDB serves as the primary data source for flag definitions, audit logs, and rule histories.

2. Frontend (React + Tailwind + Axios)
   - Admin dashboard for creating, editing, and managing feature flags.
   - Allows defining rollout strategies, simulating evaluations, and managing feature states (draft/active/archived).
   - Includes role-based access control and detailed activity auditing.

3. Evaluation SDK / Middleware
   - Lightweight library for deterministic evaluations using hash-based rollout mechanisms.
   - Provides resilience with a fallback to MongoDB when Redis is unavailable.

Key Features:
- Flag Models: Supports boolean and multivariate flags with metadata (name, owner, tags, description, lifecycle).
- Targeting Rules: Environment scoping (dev/stage/prod), user attributes (role, plan, region), and percentage rollouts.
- Low-Latency Distribution: Redis cache for hot reads and Pub/Sub for real-time updates with versioning and TTL.
- Admin UI: Create/edit flags, define rollout rules, simulate evaluations, and trigger kill switches.
- Audit & Governance: Immutable logs for all flag changes with user, timestamp, and diff view tracking.
- Observability: Metrics for evaluation rates, cache hits/misses, error tracking, and JSON export of configurations.
- Security: JWT authentication, input sanitization, scoped secrets, and ETag-based client caching.
- APIs: REST endpoints for fetching, evaluating, and mutating flags, including batch and streaming operations.
- Resilience & Testing: Rate limiting, MongoDB fallback, integration tests, and Docker Compose setup.

Technical Stack:
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Cache/Queue: Redis (Pub/Sub + Hot Cache)
Authentication: JWT
Containerization: Docker Compose
Logging & Metrics: Winston, Morgan, Prometheus (optional)

Project Architecture:
React Admin UI → Express API Server → Redis (Pub/Sub) → MongoDB (Source of Truth)

Security & Reliability:
- JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions.
- ETag headers for efficient client caching.
- Input validation and sanitization using express-validator.
- Automatic MongoDB fallback if Redis becomes unavailable.

Deployment:
- Ready for deployment using Docker Compose with:
  - MongoDB
  - Redis
  - Express API
  - React Admin UI
- Supports .env configuration for environment variables and secrets.

Future Enhancements:
- Integration with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
- Advanced analytics with Grafana and Prometheus.
- CLI-based flag management tool.
- Multi-tenant, organization-level access support.
