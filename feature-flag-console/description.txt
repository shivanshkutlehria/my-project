🧠 Project Title
Real-Time Feature Flag Management Console (MERN + Redis)

🧩 Overview

🚀 Core Components
1. Backend (Node.js + Express + Redis + MongoDB)
   - Central API for managing, evaluating, and distributing feature flags.
   - Redis used for hot caching and Pub/Sub messaging to sync updates across app nodes.
   - MongoDB acts as the source of truth for all flag definitions, audit logs, and rule histories.

2. Frontend (React + Tailwind + Axios)
   - Admin dashboard to create, edit, and manage feature flags.
   - Define rollout strategies, simulate evaluations, and control global feature states (draft/active/archived).
   - Supports role-based access and activity auditing.

3. Evaluation SDK / Middleware
   - Lightweight helper that provides deterministic evaluations using a hash-based rollout mechanism.
   - Ensures resilience with graceful fallbacks to MongoDB when Redis is unavailable.

⚙️ Key Features
- Flag Models: Boolean & multivariate flags with metadata (name, owner, tags, description, lifecycle states).
- Targeting Rules: Environment scoping (dev/stage/prod), user attributes (role, plan, region), and percentage rollouts using deterministic hashing.
- Low-Latency Distribution: Redis cache for hot reads and Pub/Sub for real-time updates. Versioning & TTL to prevent staleness.
- Admin UI: Create/edit flags, define rollout rules, simulate evaluations, trigger kill switches with confirmation.
- Audit & Governance: Immutable logs for all flag changes with who/what/when details, diff view for rule changes, and RBAC for access control.
- Observability: Metrics for evaluation rate, cache hits/misses, error tracking, and exportable JSON configuration.
- Security: JWT-protected APIs, input sanitization, scoped secrets, and ETag-based caching for clients.
- APIs: REST endpoints for fetching, evaluating, and mutating flags, including batch evaluation and streaming updates.
- Resilience & Testing: Rate limiting, MongoDB fallback on cache miss, integration tests, and Docker Compose setup (Redis + MongoDB + API + UI).

🧪 Technical Stack
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Cache/Queue: Redis (Pub/Sub + Hot Cache)
Authentication: JWT
Containerization: Docker Compose
Logging & Metrics: Winston, Morgan, Prometheus (optional)

🛠️ Project Architecture
React UI (Admin)
→ Express API Server
→ Redis (Pub/Sub)
→ MongoDB (Source of Truth)

🔒 Security & Reliability
- JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions.
- ETag headers for client caching and reduced payloads.
- Input validation and sanitization using express-validator.
- Fallback mechanism when Redis is unavailable (auto MongoDB fetch).

📈 Deployment
- Ready for deployment with Docker Compose containing:
  - MongoDB
  - Redis
  - Express API
  - React Admin UI
- Supports .env configuration for environment variables and secure secret management.

👩‍💻 Future Enhancements
- Integration with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
- Advanced analytics dashboard with Grafana/Prometheus.
- CLI-based flag management tool.
- Multi-tenant organization-level access.
