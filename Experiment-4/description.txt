This code creates a simple character counter for a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The interface includes a textarea where users can enter text, along with a live counter that 
shows the total number of characters typed. The counter updates automatically with every 
keystroke, deletion, or paste action, thanks to the `oninput` event.

The main logic is handled by the `showcount()` JavaScript function. It takes the text from 
the textarea, measures its length, and updates the <span> element (id="charcount") to display 
the current count. This provides real-time feedback without requiring a page refresh or 
form submission.

CSS is used to enhance the appearance and usability. The textarea is designed to stretch 
across the containerâ€™s width, maintain a fixed height for convenience, and have proper 
spacing from surrounding elements. The character count is styled in bold to stand out, 
making this feature useful for applications such as text fields, forms, or platforms 
that impose character limits.
