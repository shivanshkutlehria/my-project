Objective:
To create a clean, visually appealing, and responsive banking interface using HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on layout design, button styling, and responsiveness without adding JavaScript interactivity.

-> Learnings from the Experiment:
In this experiment, I learned how to design a responsive and user-friendly banking interface that displays a balance section along with Deposit and Withdraw buttons.
I gained practical understanding of:

1. Using Flexbox to arrange and align elements horizontally and vertically.

2. Applying CSS box-shadow, padding, and border-radius to give the interface a modern and professional card-like appearance.

3. Styling buttons with hover effects and color schemes to represent different actions (green for deposit, red for withdraw).

4. Utilizing media queries to adapt the button layout from row to column for smaller screens.

5. Maintaining visual hierarchy by emphasizing the balance display with larger font size and distinct color.

-> Test Cases/Scenarios Covered:

Balance Display Check:
Displayed Balance: ₹0.00 in large, bold, green text to ensure visibility and emphasis.

Deposit Button Styling:
Verified that the Deposit button appears in green color with a hover effect changing it to a darker green (#43a047).

Withdraw Button Styling:
Verified that the Withdraw button appears in red color with a hover effect changing it to a darker red (#e53935).

Layout Centering Test:
Confirmed that the interface remains perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally across all screen sizes.

Responsive Design Test:
On larger screens (width > 480px), the Deposit and Withdraw buttons appear side-by-side with equal spacing.
On smaller screens (width ≤ 480px), the buttons adjust layout for better mobile usability.

Hover Effect Validation:
Tested that hovering over each button smoothly changes its background color without affecting size or alignment.

Spacing and Padding Check:
Confirmed that the balance display and buttons maintain proper padding, gap spacing, and alignment for a neat UI.
