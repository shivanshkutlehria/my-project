HTML (Structure):

The HTML file defines the layout for the drawing tool.
A container element holds the drawing area of the tool.
Inside the container, there is a heading labeled "SVG Drawing Tool".
An <svg> element acts as the canvas where users can draw using the mouse.
HTML is solely responsible for displaying the page structure, including the title, heading, and drawing canvas.

CSS (Styling):

CSS is used to style the page and the drawing area.
The body has a simple, clean font style.
The container has a border, fixed width, and padding to organize the drawing tool neatly.
The SVG drawing canvas has its own border, a light background color, fixed dimensions (560Ã—400 pixels), and a crosshair cursor to indicate that drawing is possible.
CSS only handles the visual appearance and layout of the drawing tool.

JavaScript (Functionality):

JavaScript provides the interactive functionality of the drawing tool.
It listens for mouse events such as mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup.
When the mouse is pressed (mousedown), drawing starts and a new SVG path is initiated.
As the mouse moves (mousemove), line segments are continuously added to the path to create freehand drawing.
When the mouse is released (mouseup), drawing stops.
JavaScript is responsible for enabling users to draw inside the SVG canvas interactively.
