Project: Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Theme Switching

This project is a simple Admin Dashboard webpage. It shows how to arrange a web page using CSS Grid and how to add a dark mode without using JavaScript.

HTML Explanation
The HTML file builds the structure of the page.

1. Dark Mode Toggle
   - There is a hidden checkbox (#switch) that changes the page between light mode and dark mode.
   - The label in the header is used as the button to turn dark mode on or off.

2. Main Sections
   - Header: Shows the title "Admin Dashboard" and the dark mode label.
   - Navigation (nav): A side menu with links to Home, User, and Settings.
   - Main Content (main): A welcome message and some admin information.
   - Footer: Shows a copyright.

3. Grid Container
   - All these sections are inside a .container div.
   - CSS Grid is used to arrange them in rows and columns.

CSS Explanation
The CSS uses variables for colors, so switching between light and dark themes is easy.

1. Theme Colors
   - Light mode uses green, white, and black.
   - Dark mode changes these colors to darker shades.

2. Dark Mode Switch
   - The rule input:checked ~ .container changes the color variables when the checkbox is checked.
   - This makes dark mode work without any JavaScript.

3. Layout
   - .container uses CSS Grid:
       - Columns: Left side (150px) for menu, right side for content.
       - Rows: Header (70px), main part (auto), footer (60px).

4. Styling for Each Section
   - Header: Goes across the top and covers both columns.
   - Navigation: A vertical list of links.
   - Main: Changes background and text color depending on mode.
   - Footer: Goes across the bottom, text is centered.

5. Hidden Checkbox
   - The checkbox is hidden (display: none), and only the label is clickable.

This design makes it easy to organize the page and switch between light and dark mode using only CSS.
