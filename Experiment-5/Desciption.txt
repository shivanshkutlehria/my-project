HTML (Structure):

HTML provides the structure of the webpage. In this project, it is used to:

- Create a heading for the product list.
- Add a dropdown menu for selecting categories (All, Clothing, Electronics, Books).
- Display a list of products, with each product assigned a specific category.

HTML focuses solely on displaying the content on the page.

CSS (Styling):

CSS handles the visual styling of the webpage. In this project, it is used to:

- Set the page’s background color and font style.
- Add borders, padding, and spacing to product boxes.
- Style the dropdown menu and its labels.
- Give each product a clean box design with rounded corners, padding, margins, and borders.

CSS is responsible only for the look and appearance of the page.

JavaScript (Functionality):

JavaScript adds interactivity to the webpage. In this project, it:

- Reads the selected category from the dropdown menu.
- Checks the category of each product.
- Displays products that match the selected category and hides the rest.
- Shows all products if “All” is selected.

JavaScript manages the behavior of the page and enables the filtering functionality.
