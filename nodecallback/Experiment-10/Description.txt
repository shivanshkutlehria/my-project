Title: CLI Employee Management System Using Node.js and Arrays

Objective:
Build an interactive command-line interface (CLI) application using Node.js that manages data in memory with arrays. Practice handling user input and performing array operations.

Task Description:
Create a Node.js CLI app that stores employees in an in-memory array. The app should:
- Add an employee (name and ID)
- List all employees
- Remove an employee by ID
Use Node's built-in readline module for interactive input. No databases or files; all data exists only during the session.

How to Run:
- Ensure Node.js is installed
- Run: npm run cli
