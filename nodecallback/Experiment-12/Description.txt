Experiment 12 â€“ Seat Booking Lock API (Express)

Overview
Express server that simulates seat booking with a lock-and-confirm flow. Seats can be locked for a short time window and then confirmed to book. State is kept in memory.

How to Run
1) Open a terminal in this folder.
2) Install dependencies:
   npm install
3) Start the server:
   npm start
4) The API listens on http://localhost:3000

Key Behavior
- A lock lasts for 60 seconds. If not confirmed within that time, the lock expires and the seat becomes available again.

Endpoints
- GET /seats
  Returns the current status of all seats: available | locked | booked.

- POST /lock/:seatId
  Locks the seat if available. Fails if already booked or currently locked by another user.

- POST /confirm/:seatId
  Confirms a previously locked seat (must be within the lock window). Books the seat on success.

Example Requests (curl)
# view all seats
curl http://localhost:3000/seats

# lock seat 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/lock/1

# confirm seat 1 (within 60 seconds)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/confirm/1

Notes
- This demo uses in-memory data and resets on server restart.
